# Plinko

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7.

## Running the devlopment server

Run `npm run start` or `npm start` to start the dev server. Afterwards navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Framework chosen

I am using Angular 16 due to it being Typescript-based and offloads the hassle of managing imports through NPM (Node Package Manager) as well as the serving of the content through a Node enviroment.
